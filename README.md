#Lorem Ipsum stock tracking
This is a react webapp using crud operations to store local stock userdata on a RESTful API via mongodb.
We used TwelveData API and FinnHub API for the stock and information in real time. You will need API keys for those yourself if you want to run the app.

#To get running

Start by going into the base folder and running

```
npm install
```

then:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

then:

```
cd ../server

You will need a mongodb with 2 collections. one of the stock data and the second of user data.
